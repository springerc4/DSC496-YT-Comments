Technology wasn’t the reason they’re far so it does help to have technology to connect us and shorten our physical distance. And boy it helps when you’re feeling lonely. To be able to see someone on FaceTime and live talk to them sometimes feels magical knowing how far they are. A digital hologram would be AWESOME!

Something I missed during the Pandemic was the ability to be in a classroom while teaching a class.  My dream for this type of technology in the future is to have a “Jedi Council” moment where folks can be in a “class” and see everyone around them, even if they are at home.

But, it also isn't (Obviously), the feeling and the need for reality was observant. This is also relevant in the company HUMANE* ideals, even more interesting in the fact that they set up their company on the idea of going back to reality and having tech interact with us, instead of the other way around. 

With some of the creators of iPhone taking part of being in a company that wants to go away from screens, I would find that a really interesting talk. 

I also have to say, these video's are so uplifting. It's rare to find genuine videos that do that without the intention from the get go. It's an incredible skill and definitely something I would say you have mastered.",1

I know there are coats out there that if you hug someone in a pair the second can be felt from anywhere while wearing the second coat. We've seen this a lot in science fiction. I think the best example of this is through Ready Player One where the suite allows you to feel the blows of other players. I think once they get the headset where it needs to be adding in the touch will be next. Then who knows maybe smell or taste. That would truly be amazing.,2

With them, it wasn't about games or talking to people. It was watching 3D 180 videos of festival events or fireworks which due to their age or physical limitations could not go to anymore. Another big demo were the underwater or aquarium style settings and there's this 92 year-old Japanese lady grabbing at small fish and smiling at how much enjoyment she's having. 

Yeah, it's basically the ""teleportation"". What I also see it, based on when I was an instructor in the US Navy, is overcoming the practical laboratory limitations most training schools have. If like the F1 car, I could bring in satellite communication equipment and get people training virtually up to a standard before spending precious time of in person practicals, that would be far more effective.  Now extend that concept to labs for colleges.",207

Imagine you're walking downtown (hopefully with a smaller headset by then) and your friend calls. They ""teleport"" next to you as you walk. They are able to see you as you walk as if they were next to you in that moment. The cameras are able to pick up so much detail already, it wouldn't be that far off for them to use the sensor as well to make you feel like you're next to the ""host"". Or in someone's house, it would be awesome to feel like your friend is sitting on your couch and they can also see your house.

One has to constantly make sure it's charged, it's cumbersome to wear, and it can only be safely used in a limited space.  It's much easier to sit down at a desktop computer or lie on my bed with my phone.  I do expect VR/AR tech to improve, and I'm interested in that future.",1

Let me explain: the vision platform would need to add small drones with cameras ( three would suffice ) which would merge the person wearing the Vision Pro with their surroundings. Those meeting-up online decide which space they're in. It could be either participants space, or a common virtual space... like the moon scape. Through the Bees' video feed the Vision Pro has eyes on the outside.This would allow it to always know the position of the user in their surroundings. The Bees would also allow users to see each others backs. And the Bees would show the remote participant the whole space ( not only the field of view of the Vision Pro ) including their communication partner. Only drawback would be having so see the other persons real body attached to their face avatar... that would be mega uncanny valley. :D",0
n7hJlyVDEc8,2024-02-06T14:06:02Z,Apple,The Real Reason To Care About The Apple Vision Pro,Cleo Abram,438987,22692,"Personally, I hope V10 is contacts. Allowing us to remove the headset idea, and utilize contacts that can be perfect for vision for those of us that need actual contacts. Then the rest of the world can use a contact version that is not prescription based.

This allows everyone to look legit normal in the real world and your eye movement will be how it determines things, along with what you see here.

I'd also love if it we can take images or scan our environment around us. Like rooms or entire homes. Then be able to visit them as they were in that time.

Perhaps also having an AR tech that can identify pattern issues from wrecks or damages to a home. Knowing when, and how something happened by being able to essentially go back in time with the accident. Similar to what you see in The Division as well as games like Watchdogs. That could be extremely useful for this type of tech to offer us down the line.

By V10, I expect a lot of this and so much more. V1 looks pretty good but by V5, we're going to be seeing some crazy cool stuff. By V10, we might be able to do so much cool stuff that hasn't even been thought up yet. Which is very exciting!",1

n7hJlyVDEc8,2024-02-06T14:06:02Z,Apple,The Real Reason To Care About The Apple Vision Pro,Cleo Abram,438987,22692,"My query is the touch element. You know, like how children need a high level of physical contact during the first six months or they’re developmentally compromised. 

Touch starvation is a thing and physical presence is something we often overlook. While we may have many more ways to connect to each other, we rarely end up regularly using them. Loneliness has only gotten worse over the last couple of decades. 
Casey Neistat’s video on the Vision Pro was also really great, but it was as terrifying as it was cool. As with most tech, the potential is awesome and theoretically limitless. But day-to-day use can often boil down to the lowest common denominator.


I know how that’s a bit of a doomer take, but I don’t often see the fields of technology and positive psychology overlapping.

Regardless, love the video Cleo! More great and thoughtful insights, I always look forward to seeing them.",430

A half decent avatar overlaid with simple 3d video (maybe just a second camera on a laptop) might be able to go a long way to increasing immersion. Small improvements to existing background filtering can help put you both in the same virtual space. For interviews, meetings, anything where you would usually be sitting down I want to see that step coming up if it isn't yet

Albeit the experiences found in VR chat and the like are entirely virtual and aren't as refined as what limited experiences the vision pro offers.

The concept of using a scan of yourself as an avatar to be projected into the life of someone else's via a headset is so interesting to think about for example. But it will be limited in the technology we could have in the future. Imagine being able to track your body entirely through the headset itself without any external trackers! It would be crazy!

Being able to ""visit"" a friend's place or recorded memories in 3d space or could be achieved via a detailed scan of their room or house would be the next big step in that. The iPhone is currently the easiest tool to use in order to get that visual information.

I feel like that connection is entirely possible right now, it's just a matter of money and tech to make it as refined as what apple has",0

I'd say that presence is the product here, not teleportation, not VR, not AR, not some fancy technology. I hate terms like Metaverse and all the other jargon. What this is, is the natural progression of the interconnectivity between humans, the internet, digital and physical places and the devices we use to access them.

And ps, a good way to imagine where this tech is leading is to forget about a device altogether. It'll become be a contact lens or eye/ear implant, and  eventually (for better or for worse) a neural implant which bypasses the a-b-c-d-z path and just goes straight to z.",0

At this rate we're gonna reach a point where we will be interacting with someone through their 3D model while that person is sleeping or doing something else.

I think the isolation is a real problem as we get more and more technologically advanced. The ability to be around others even virtually is something that is extremely important as we navigate this evolutionary pathway.

VR, AR, XR, what ever you call it, is not a gaming platform, or a productivity platform, its a social and a networking platform. I get to see my partner everyday and cuddle on virtual couches as we watch our favorite movies side by side, sneaking her little kisses on the neck that of course she can't feel, but she hears and sees the intention, and it translates really well. I recently met up irl with my VR friend group who i see every night and have known for years. We kept on remarking on how much its the same to seeing each other in VR. And although those hugs goodbye were hard, they also wernt hard, because I was going to see them the next day. All my friends dancing together in virtual clubs, standing in a circle, drinking, except on friend is on the west coast, another on the east, one in germany, another in japan, one in australia. We don't feel that distance so much, because we are with each other all of the time. So our hugs wern't so much goodbyes, but see you tomorrows",0

Right now, they both have to load up the same thing, to have a similar experience but not a shared one. And I think that's a leap the next versions have to make.

You could scan your space and achieve it as a 3D model.. And when ever, you could bring it up, vision pro would be able to tell where exactly in your house, office, or ""space"" via geotagging or so, and allow you invite someone into your space.. There you could share objects, etc. 

Yeah. The other person might have to navigate that space slightly different, maybe walking, but turning would have to be based on a virtual wheel scroll something.. 

Maybe a cool way to interact and not be alone covering your eyes from the real world..",0

I had this feeling about telepresence after watching several reviews and couldn’t believe no one else was talking about the Vision Pro as being the first step in Apple’s journey into its own kind of Metaverse.

Like there was first huge mainframe computers for big company that could manage couple users at the same time for business. Now today we’ve phones in our pocket with huge strength to be used as PC, entertainment and socialising device. From most simple mors code communication to 3D visual and surround. This new tech could maybe replace our tv, pc, radio/home theater system. Either tech tools on work floor. But combination, changes of use of, rules of use and dependency on fewer devices is something that will make the changes a huge and many challenges.

At the same time, all social issue relaying and require on interaction with other  people, I think, makes it harder by tech, not helping. The combination of want to use the new tech, so people should like the tech, but also by making the tech more likeable, there is less room for people for the limit time, space and joy, so people ends up easier alone in isolation.

But we should not let us stop of exploring.

The hard work you put in to creating this is obvious and I love your message.  I actually have a very different take on the ""Eyesight"" and ""Persona"" hating I'm seeing in so many reviews.  The person you're looking at IS in an artificially generated 3D environment.  There's no pretense that the technology has reached the stage you look forward to in this video.  The ""Persona"" is not a video camera feed !  We KNOW that !  It's generated by a computer.  BY DEFINITION it's not real and it looks LIKE that - just as you'd expect.  Same with ""Eyesight"".  I for one hope Apple isn't listening to all the haters about ""Eyesight"" and that they don't drop it.  Improve it, yes but seeing someone looking like VR while they're experiencing VR makes total sense to me.  Anyway, thanks for the video !",0

Yes it was very innovative, but it was a similar size, shape, and cost as other devices in use at the time - it wasn't a new form factor, it didn't have a new use case. Within a decade almost every phone looked the same. And whilst VR / AR may well be part of our future, it's not going to explode in this way until it's the right price, but more importantly it solves a genuine day to day problem. Right now AR with the right software could be useful in a professional environment, but in the day to day? The tech would pretty much have to be a solid Star Trek holodeck experience before the masses came to it.",17

VR up until now has been a niche product based around games but not everyone wants to game in a VR headset. Video calls seemed like very Sci-fi in the past, with television screens built into walls where you once used to have your landline phone. Now the realisation of that is even better and more convenient: a screen and a camera in something you can put in your pocket.

I noticed in this video you were doing parallel operations to share the experience but if you could have one primary headset you could have something very interesting. You could share an environment and because each headset has their own sensors each person would have the correct perspective of the world or object. Or playing a virtual game together that could be neat.,0

FYI, there is accessibility navigation options for the Vision Pro. There’s a function where you can gaze at an item for a few seconds and it will select it for you. Also, if you don’t have fingers or hands I’m pretty sure the device can track your limbs. Along with voice control! I’m unaware of the other accessibility features, but I’m sure there’s some other things like voiceover. 🙂 Hoping they release a physical controller for accessibility at some point.",19

However, the reasons behind the fall in share price are more complex. Key factors likely include softened demand forecasts for electric vehicles industry-wide along with strengthening competition from Chinese manufacturers that can offer lower prices.

The bias is so cringe worthy it sends chills through to my spine. So I decided to see what the comments were. It was so refreshing to find out that all the comments as far as I was prepared to scroll all see through the crud. I am not worried about missing and news worthy articles when I pass over these networks. However from time to time I do stop to see if they say anything of worth. It is always spin and shock aimed at a weak mind that likes to be fed. I suppose empty minds need to be fed processed food because they can't afford the cost of (thinking for oneself) real fruit 🍓,19

Tesla will not expand the transportation market, and won't even maintain share of EVs and yet it is priced to take 90% of automotive AND also more than double margins.  It's a fantasy.
AI is also mispriced.  At best it is weapon that most industries will need to buy.  The value of the service it provides is overestimated. Managers talk it up but never mention that the biggest cost AI can eliminate is them!  As long as management refuses to fire themselves, AI value will be negligible.
The 7 were dumped when interest rates rose -that was a mistake because it didn't consider that high margins insulate them from loss in a slow economy -so the stocks went back up the next year!  This year they are up on advertising gains and election spending.",2

Yes he paid that money to that woman. He didn't want it to take the spotlight of our beautiful Queen's Jubilee events that were happening. Yes he was in bad company but he could have been possibly set up because of who he was. I've noticed ever since this document came out it only about half a dozen names out of God knows how many that keep being repeated. If that's the case with Prince Andrew, every name on that list should be mentioned.  Instead of repeating the same names over and over while the rest of them go unnoticed. Bit unfair isn't it.

Nothing concrete and no production dates.  No delivery dates  either.  These two are probably cramming for ideas to pitch before their contract ends like two school kids cramming to finish their paper the night before it is due.  
And the quality of what they are pitching is probably going to be just as poor of an effort.  
One of the ideas that Harry supposedly was going to pitch was about this African charities.  Unless they are ghoulish and disgusting enough to make money off of the violence against the tribes by the African Parks rangers, then it would be beyond bad form to doing any unscripted show about Africa or their fake humanitarianism.  But who know with these two? Their self-insight is extremely poor.

Tesla will not expand the transportation market, and won't even maintain share of EVs and yet it is priced to take 90% of automotive AND also more than double margins.  It's a fantasy.
AI is also mispriced.  At best it is weapon that most industries will need to buy.  The value of the service it provides is overestimated. Managers talk it up but never mention that the biggest cost AI can eliminate is them!  As long as management refuses to fire themselves, AI value will be negligible.
The 7 were dumped when interest rates rose -that was a mistake because it didn't consider that high margins insulate them from loss in a slow economy -so the stocks went back up the next year!  This year they are up on advertising gains and election spending.",2

If so this plus may soon be rendered useless since they would not be the choice of upper middle to higher classes; which are responsible for most of the carbon emissions. So unless they are proven to be lesser carbon footprints 👣 AND they replace existing traditional homes in volume, they would just be an item to an already never ending market of products. In US, it would be interesting to see how things work out with high profile builders and residential codes - if they would allow for them. 
(2) More resilient to natural disasters is a big plus point. 
(3) Agree convenience and speed is taking over the actual real pleasure of walking through the process(es) and that buying a home would no longer be a lifetime decision but it’s not the first time it’s happening and it probably won’t be the last. It’s similar to how people miss writing letters and instead chose WhatsApp. May be some traditions will be revived but how would it if newer generations don’t have a lookback. Revival is more likely for someone who can do the compare. Additionally if we really look at climate impacts; we already don’t have much quota on high carbon structures hence green buildings like rammed earth, mud etc are be talked about.
(4) How much we value our living spaces - this statement needs to be considered at a larger scale - example expensive California homes falling into creeks and becoming dirt due to climate change impacts, and for India it seems like we have long neglected to keep our streets and surroundings clean. Even the financial capital Mumbai - home to the richest does not look anything like we value our living spaces. On contrary a humble village in NE India and Indore earned the title.
